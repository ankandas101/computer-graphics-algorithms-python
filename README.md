# Graphics Algorithms in Python
This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental computer graphics algorithms. Each algorithm prints the generated points and plots them using `matplotlib`.
## Algorithms Included

1. **DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) Line Algorithm**  
   - Incremental line drawing algorithm.
   - Prints each point and plots the line.
   
2. **Bresenham Line Algorithm**  
   - Efficient integer-based line drawing.
   
3. **Midpoint Circle Algorithm**  
   - Circle drawing using midpoint decision method.
   
4. **Bresenham Circle Algorithm**  
   - Integer-based circle drawing, faster and accurate.
   
5. **Adaptive Decision Boundary Algorithm**  
   - Line drawing with adaptive decision boundary for better accuracy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib`

Install matplotlib if not already installed:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
Run any algorithm file. For example, DDA:
```bash
python dda.py
```
